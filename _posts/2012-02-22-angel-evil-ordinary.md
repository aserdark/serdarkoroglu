This post is the result of a conversation with a friend of mine. Generally people categorizes other people as either good or evil. For me, we actually deal with 3 kinds of personality: The angel type, the evil type and the most common ordinary type. There is an interesting puzzle called [The Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hardest_Logic_Puzzle_Ever "Wikipedia") where there are three gods that either speak correct, wrong or random all the time. The objective of the puzzle is to find who’s who by asking yes-no questions. This is indeed a very correct abstraction of real human character types. (**spoiler alert**) The answer of the puzzle starts with identifying the random person first (**end of spoiler**). Maybe this tactic is all you need to solve real type of human interaction problems. Anyway, I listed some key properties of these three types.

  * Angel and Evil -> predictable (they have a clear and meaningful objective); Ordinary people -> random (they think they have an objective but their behavioural outcomes are unpredictable)
  * Angel makes decisions complying with a moral code; evil ignores morality; ordinary people doesn’t have a morality standard i.e. their vision of morality can be modified externally
  * Angel and evil are usually active decision makers; whereas moron (did I say moron? I meant ordinary people) goes with the flow
  * Number of angels and evils are very small compared to number of ordinary people
  * **Angel keywords:** equality, self-sacrificing, overall outcome, trusting, optimistic, love
  * **Evil keywords:** the best, greediness, narcissism, exploitative, egocentric, insensitivity, opportunism
  * **Ordinary people keywords:** now, fear, low self-esteem, co-dependence, adaptive, prejudice, lack of control
